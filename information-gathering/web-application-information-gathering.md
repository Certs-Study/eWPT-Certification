# ðŸ˜€ Web Application Information Gathering

Web application information gathering, also known as web application reconnaissance or web application enumeration, is a specific type of information gathering that focuses on collecting intelligence about web applications and their associated infrastructure.&#x20;

Web applications are software programs that run on web servers and are accessed through web browsers, allowing users to interact with the application via a graphical user interface (GUI) over the internet.

Web application information gathering is a critical phase in the process of securing web applications, as it helps ethical hackers identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses that may be exploited by malicious actors.&#x20;

The goal is to gather as much information as possible about the web application and its environment, including its architecture, technology stack, configuration, and potential security loopholes.

There are several techniques and tools that are commonly used in web application information gathering.&#x20;

These include:

### Website reconnaissance

This involves collecting information about the target website, such as its domain name, IP address, hosting provider, web server software, and CMS (Content Management System) if any. This information can help in understanding the target's infrastructure and technology stack.

### Web application mapping

This involves systematically mapping the structure and functionality of the web application, including identifying all the accessible pages, directories, and resources.&#x20;

This can be done manually by navigating through the web application or by using automated tools like web crawlers, such as Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, or Scrapy.

### URL and parameter manipulation

This involves manipulating URLs and parameters of the web application to uncover potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations. For example, appending different parameters to URLs, modifying values, and testing for input validation issues, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

### Information leakage&#x20;

This involves searching for information leakage through the web application, such as error messages, comments, or hidden fields, which may reveal sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, or internal system details.

### Enumeration of web application technologies

This involves identifying the technologies used in the web application, such as programming languages, frameworks, databases, and third-party libraries.&#x20;

This information can help in understanding the potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors associated with these technologies.

### Fingerprinting and reconnaissance of web server and application framework

This involves identifying the version numbers and configurations of the web server software, web application frameworks, and other technologies used in the web application.&#x20;

This information can be used to identify known vulnerabilities and weaknesses associated with these versions and configurations.

### Brute force attacks

This involves attempting to guess or crack passwords for user accounts, administration interfaces, or other protected areas of the web application. This can be done using automated tools, such as Hydra or Medusa, or through manual techniques.
