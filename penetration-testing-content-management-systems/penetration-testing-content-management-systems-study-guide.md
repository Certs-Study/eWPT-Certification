# ðŸ˜€ Penetration Testing Content Management Systems - Study Guide

Penetration testing, also known as ethical hacking, is a critical process in ensuring the security of web applications and systems. Content Management Systems (CMS) are widely used platforms that power many websites, making them an important target for security assessments.&#x20;

This study guide will provide an overview of penetration testing for CMS, including key concepts, methodologies, tools, and best practices.

### Understanding Content Management Systems (CMS)

* CMS overview: Understand the basic concepts and functionalities of CMS, including how they manage content, user authentication, and access control.
* Popular CMS platforms: Familiarize yourself with popular CMS platforms, such as WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, and others, as they have different vulnerabilities and attack surfaces.
* CMS architecture: Learn about the typical architecture and components of CMS, including databases, web servers, plugins, themes, and templates.

### Penetration Testing Methodology for CMS

#### Reconnaissance

Conduct reconnaissance and information gathering on the target CMS, including identifying the CMS version, plugins, themes, and vulnerabilities.

#### Vulnerability scanning

Use automated vulnerability scanning tools, such as Nessus, OpenVAS, or Nikto, to identify known vulnerabilities in the CMS and its plugins/themes.

#### Manual testing

Conduct manual penetration testing techniques, such as manual vulnerability scanning, authentication bypass, privilege escalation, cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and other web application attacks.

#### Exploitation

Exploit the identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, and gain control over the CMS and underlying systems.

#### Reporting

Document the findings, vulnerabilities, and exploitation results, and prepare a comprehensive report for stakeholders with recommendations for remediation.

### Penetration Testing Tools for CMS

* CMS-specific tools: Utilize CMS-specific tools, such as WPScan for WordPress, Droopescan for Drupal, Joomscan for Joomla, and others, to identify vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
* Web vulnerability scanners: Use popular web vulnerability scanners, such as Burp Suite, Acunetix, or OWASP ZAP, to automate the scanning process and identify common web application vulnerabilities.
* Exploitation frameworks: Familiarize yourself with exploitation frameworks, such as Metasploit, to automate the exploitation of known vulnerabilities in CMS and other web applications.
* Manual testing tools: Use manual testing tools, such as SQLMap for SQL injection, XSSer for cross-site scripting, and others, to conduct in-depth manual testing for specific vulnerabilities.

### Best Practices for CMS Penetration Testing

#### Obtain proper authorization

Always obtain explicit authorization from the system owner before conducting any penetration testing activities on CMS or any other web application.

#### Follow ethical guidelines

Adhere to ethical hacking guidelines, including not causing harm, not stealing data, not disrupting services, and not violating any laws or regulations.

#### Stay updated

Keep yourself updated with the latest vulnerabilities, patches, and security news related to CMS platforms, plugins, and themes.

#### Document and report

Properly document all findings, including vulnerabilities, exploits, and methodologies used during the testing, and prepare a comprehensive report with recommendations for remediation.

#### Responsible disclosure

Follow responsible disclosure practices by notifying the CMS vendor or system owner about the vulnerabilities discovered and providing them with adequate time to fix the issues before publicly disclosing them.

#### Continuous learning

Continuously learn and improve your skills through hands-on practice, research, and staying updated with the latest developments in the field of CMS security and penetration testing.
